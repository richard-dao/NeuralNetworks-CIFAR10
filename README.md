# Part 1: Neural Network
Step 1: Design, compile, train, and evaluate a simple neural network

Step 2: Experiment with different activation functions and evaluate their influence on model performance

Step 3: Adjust and experiment with the number of parameters

Step 4: Experiment with the depth and width of neural networks

Step 5: Build an optimized neural network based on observations from previous tasks and analyze the performance.

# Part 2: Convolutional neural network
Use CNN to replace the vanilla neural network from Part 1 and report findings.
